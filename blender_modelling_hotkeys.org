* UI Shortcuts

  * ~Click~ on a panel arrow to collapse/expand one, while clicked drag up or down to do the same to other panels too
  * ~Ctrl + click~ a panel to expand just that and collapse its siblings else
  * Zoom a region with panels with ~Ctrl + MMB~ drag; hover over window and press ~Home~ to reset zoom
  * In Properties Window, hover the mouse over some pane area and switch to different tabs with ~Ctrl + wheel~.  See [[https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/interface/window_system/tabs_panels.html][documentation on tabs and panels]].
  * Hold ~Shift~ and click-drag a numeric input box to alter its value in finer steps.  While dragging use ~Ctrl~ to make the steps discrete.  ~Ctrl + wheel~ makes the steps more finer.
  * Negate a field by pressing minus when hovering over it; use / for reciprocal.
  * [[https://blender.stackexchange.com/a/94346/53932][Angle input suffixes]]: (d)egrees and (r)adians
  * Hold ~Alt~ to apply edit to all selected entities, not just the active selection
  * Expressions can be typed into numeric fields e.g. ~pi * sqrt(2) - 1.2~ (they can even be animated with [[https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/animation/drivers/index.html][Drivers]]).
  * Multiple fields can be edited to the same value by ~PMB~ click and drag and then type/drag a value.  See [[https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/interface/controls/buttons/fields.html][documentation on fields]].
  * To copy a colour, hover the mouse over a colour box, ~Ctrl + C~ and do the same with ~Ctrl + V~ in a target colour box.  Alternatively, drag-drop from source to destination!
  * Change a colour field with an eye dropper by hovering over it and pressing E.  Select a colour from anywhere on the screen (click and drag averages the colours).
  * Value (darkness) of a colour can be changed with ~Ctrl~ + mouse wheel 
  * On Colour Picker, hold ~Ctrl~ to snap to primary colours; hold ~Shift~ to be precise; wheel to adjust brightness and Backspace to reset
  * Fit entire animation span to Timeline window with Home key
  * Reset an entity (e.g. scale) by hovering over it and pressing ~Backspace~; can be dragged to reset multiple entities (hold ~Ctrl~ to reset just one fields of an entity)
  * Copy an entity's property value to others by selecting them all (making sure the source is the active selection), right-clicking on the field -> Copy Single To Selected.  If it's a vector like location (x, y, z), then Copy All to Selected will copy all the elements of the field.
  * ~Alt + SMB~ to select occluded objects
  * Paths starting ~//~ is a handy way to specify the directory where current .blend is at
  * Outliner has toggleable options for objects to be selectable, current viewport visibility, render visibility and disable i.e. visibility in all view layers including linked scenes in other .blend files; quite useful
  * Camera with a filled up arrow is the Active one; useful in a multi-camera scene
